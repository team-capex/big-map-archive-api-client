## Quick start

### Installation

`big-map-archive-api-client` is a Python package hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/big-map-archive-api-client/).

We recommend that you proceed as follows to install the Python package and its dependencies on a Linux machine:

1. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv /home/<username>/.virtualenvs/<virtual_env_name>
```

2. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source /home/<username>/.virtualenvs/<virtual_env_name>/bin/activate
```

3. Install the `wheel` package if needed (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69369669/python-3-venv-and-the-wheel-package))

```bash
pip install wheel
```

4. Install the `big-map-archive-api-client` package along with its dependencies in the virtual environment.
Install version 1.2.0 for the latest version of the BIG-MAP Archive:

```bash
pip install big-map-archive-api-client==1.2.0
```

5. [Optional] Once installed, check that the executable file associated with `bma` is indeed located in the virtual environment:

```bash
which bma
```

6. [Optional] Create a project directory (to store configuration, input, and output files).

### Configuration files

Each command requires a YAML configuration file that specifies the domain name and an API token for the targeted data repository. 
This is indicated by the command options `--config-file` and `--bma-config-file`. 
We also recommend to place such a file in your project directory and to name it `bma_config.yaml`. Its content should be similar to:

```yaml
domain_name: "archive-capex.energy.dtu.dk" # Options: archive.big-map.eu, archive-demo-capex.energy.dtu.dk, archive-demo-big-map.eu
port: 5000
token: "123456789"
```

Note that to get an API token for the targeted BIG-MAP Archive, you need an account on the data repository. 
To request an account, email us at big-map-archive@materialscloud.org. 
Once logged in, navigate to `https://<archive_domain_name>/account/settings/applications` and create a token.

The command `bma finales-db back-up` requires another YAML configuration file that specifies the IP address and the port for the targeted FINALES server, and credentials for a user account on the server.
This corresponds to the command option `--finales-config-file`. 
We recommend to place such a file in your project directory and to name it `finales_config.yaml`. Its content should be similar to:
```yaml
ip_address: "0.0.0.0" # Replace by IP address for a FINALES server
port: "1234" # Replace by port for a FINALES server
username: "test" # Replace by valid username
password: "test" # Replace by valid password
```

### Metadata files

Several commands (e.g., `bma record create`) use a YAML file specified by the command option `--metadata-file` to create/update a record's metadata. 
We recommend to place such a file in your project directory and to name it `metadata.yaml`. Its content should be similar to:

```yaml
resource_type: "Dataset" # Choose one of these options: Dataset, Software, Other
title: "Mobilities in Two-Dimensional Materials" # Record's title
authors: # Record's list of authors with their affiliations
  - family_name: "Doe"
    given_name: "Jane"
    affiliations:
      - "Physics Institute, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland"
  - family_name: "Dell"
    given_name: "John"
    affiliations:
      - "Department of Physics, Technical University of Denmark (DTU), 2800 Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"
      - "Physics Institute, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland"
description: "Two-dimensional materials are emerging as a promising platform for ultrathin channels..." # Abstract-like description of the record

keywords: # Any keyword is accepted
  - "2D materials"
  - "transport"
references: # Choose among these options for the reference scheme: arxiv, doi, isbn, url
  - scheme: "arxiv"
    identifier: "2308.08462"
  - scheme: "doi"
    identifier: "10.1093/ajae/aaq063"
  - scheme: "isbn"
    identifier: "978-3-16-148410-0"
  - scheme: "url"
    identifier: "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08462"
```

### Data files

Two commands offer the possibility to attach data files of your choosing to your records: `bma record create` and `bma record update`.

Please comply with the following rules: 
- a maximum of 100 files per record and 
- a total file size smaller than 100 GB per record.

The command option `--data-files` should point to the directory where the files to be uploaded and attached to the new record are located. We usually place such a folder in our project directory and name it `upload`.

### Community

To publish a record to a community you need to specify the community `slug`.
Login at `https://<archive_domain_name>`. The list of communities you have access to is at the link `https://<archive_domain_name>/api/communities`. Look for the value slug, you will need to add this value when publishing a record to the community. Example: for the BIG-MAP community the slug is bigmap, for BATTERY2030 the slug is battery2030.

## Usage

You may want to test a command against a [demo instance](https://big-map-archive-demo.materialscloud.org/), before executing it against the [main data repository](https://archive.big-map.eu/).

### Back up FINALES databases

```bash
bma finales-db back-up --help
```

```text
Usage: bma finales-db back-up [OPTIONS]

  Back up the SQLite database of a FINALES server to a BIG-MAP Archive. This creates and publishes a new entry version, which provides links to data extracted from the database (capabilities, requests, and results for requests) and a copy of the whole database.
Options:
  --bma-config-file FILE          Path to the YAML file that specifies the
                                  domain name and a personal access token for
                                  the targeted BIG-MAP Archive. See
                                  bma_config.yaml in the GitHub repository.
                                  [required]
  --finales-config-file FILE      Path to the YAML file that specifies the IP
                                  address, the port, and the credentials of a

  --record-id TEXT                Id of the published version for the previous
                                  back-up (e.g., "pxrf9-zfh45"). For the first
                                  back-up, leave to the default.
  --metadata-file FILE            Path to the YAML file that contains the
                                  metadata (title, list of authors, etc) for
                                  creating a new version. See data/input/examp
                                  le/create_record/metadata.yaml in the GitHub
                                  repository.  [required]
  --link-all-files-from-previous  Link all files that are already linked to
                                  the previous version to the new version,
                                  with the exception of files whose content
                                  changed.
  --no-publish                    Do not publish the newly created version.
                                  This is discouraged in production. If you
                                  select this option, either publish or delete
                                  the newly created draft, e.g., via the GUI.
  --slug TEXT                     Community slug of the record. Example: for
                                  the BIG-MAP community the slug is bigmap.
                                  [required]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
````

While executing the command, a user will be asked for confirmation if:
- The user attempts to create an entry (i.e., no record id is provided) but he/she already owns a published record with the same title. This is to prevent users from creating new entries inadvertently. 
- The user tries to update an existing entry (a record id is provided) but the new version would have a different title. This is to enforce our 'one title per "campaign"' policy (see [Back-up policy for FINALES databases](#back-up-policy-for-finales-databases))

When backing up a production database, put the corresponding `metadata.yaml` file under version control in the [big-map-archive-api-client-finales](https://github.com/materialscloud-org/big-map-archive-api-client-finales) GitHub repository. 

## Back-up policy for FINALES databases

The following back-up policy applies to the database of FINALES servers in production:
- There should be a single entry in the main BIG-MAP Archive per "campaign" on the FINALES server.
- An entry may have multiple versions, with one version created and published each time a back-up of the database occurs. Note that if a data file remains unchanged from one version to the next, the file is uploaded only once. However, the corresponding file link appears in the two entry versions. This saves storage space and reduces back-up time. 
- A title is given to each version of an entry. It can be changed but, since it serves as an identifier of the campaign, should ideally remain unchanged across all versions of the same entry. To enforce this 'one title per "campaign"' policy, the command `bma finales-db back-up` asks for confirmation if the user attempts to change the title while creating a new version. 
- A single service account is used for doing back-ups of a given "campaign".
- The same service account can be used for multiple "campaigns".
